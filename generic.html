									<h1>About<br />
									Lucas Sanchez</h1>
									<p>Narrative Designer, Level Designer, Coder, Producer</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Me.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>Hello there!  My name is Lucas Sanchez, a video game producer, designer (level and narrative), and programmer, with a passion for creating video games that immerse players with immersive gameplay and enthraling, deep storytelling.  </p>
								<p>I grew up in Miami, Florida, and from a young age, as far back as middle school, began exploring my passion for video game storytelling, creating Role-Playing Games in scratch initially as a school project, but inevitably continuing even past submission to create the kind of game I always wanted to see in the world.  It was around this time that I also began writing, initially, where many writers begin, with fanfiction, this eventually evolving into my own short stories, book series, and even comics.  Now, nearly a decade later, after honing my skills in this time and having graduated with a dual major in Game Design and Creative Writing at the University of Central Florida, I continue to pursue these passions.</p>
								<p>If I only had a limited time and space to describe myself, the first word I would use is creative.  Be it an idea for a story, setting, character, level design, or solution to a programming dilemma, I value my ability to brainstorm, work with others, and come up with a solution or idea that not only works, but also hasn't been thought of before.  I also value my ability to work well with others, be it through collaborative brainstorming and work or easing and resolving conflicts between creative minds, programmers, etc., a skill I had to develop while serving as producer for my program's capstone project on a team of over a dozen.  I value cooperation and understanding, and while I take pride in my skills and expertise, am capable of recognizing the talents of others too and knowing that my ideas do not take precedent over others simply by merit of being mine.  There is strength in the ideas of others, and I believe that the best outcome to any solution is one that hears from the mind of others in a cooperative and open fashion.</p>
								<p>While I now consider myself a person who has extensive experience in video game programming and back-end management with guiding teams and projects from start to completion, my specialty and passion is in design.  Particularly, I am at my strongest when creating stories that deeply involve players in feeling as though they themselves are a part of the narrative, be it through deep and complex characters, elaborate and enthralling plotlines, or offering as much freedom to the player as possible to change the story in accordance to their choices.</p>
								<p>My skills, by merit of the undergrad program I graduated from and graduate program I now find myself in, are quite varied.  In this time I have been forced to create solo game projects, resulting in me having gained a number of skills.</p>
									<ul>
										<li>A Proficiency in 2D Art (2D Digital Art, 2D Character Design, 2D Environment Design)</li>
										<li>A Proficiency in 3D Art (3D Character Modeling, 3D Prop Modeling, Environmental Modeling)</li>
										<li>An Understanding of 3D and 2D Animation</li>
										<li>A Proficiency in numerous art programs (PhotoShop and PhotoShop equivalents, Blender, Maya, ZBrush)</li>
										<li>An Expertise in Environmental and Level Design</li>
										<li>A proficiency in UI And Systems Design</li>
										<li>An Expertise in Writing and Narrative Design</li>
										<li>A proficiency in Production and Project Management</li>
										<li>An Expertise in Scriptwriting Software (Final Draft, CeltX, etc.)</li>
										<li>An Expertise in Programming (C, C#, C++, P5.js, html)</li>
									</ul>
								<p>My goal is to find myself working as a narrative designer in a video game studio working on a project that values creativity and telling a good story, an objective for which I believe video games are the perfect medium.  I can also see myself working in other positions, however, such as level designer, scriptwriter, or anything else that would allow me to creatively work on a project I am passionate about.</p>
								<p>If you wish to know more about my work, I encourage you to look at my projects and past work or to reach out to me.  Thank you for visiting!</p>
